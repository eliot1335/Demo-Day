# Movie Data Classification and Visualization

This project is to showcase all that I have learned from Datavis course. With several movie datasets acquired from Kaggle, I created an interactive scatter plot to visual the relationship between budget and revenue of the movies in different genres. I also created a Multi-Label Classifier using machine learning technique to classify and predict movie genres using the description from dataset.

It is displayed in html with API from my Flask App to query necessary data that lives locally in my MongoDB. The website also showcase my knowledge about JavaScript and CSS.
